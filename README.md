# Wine-Classification-using-Naive-Bayes
This project focuses on classifying wine types using the Naive Bayes algorithm, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The project utilizes the sklearn.datasets wine dataset, which includes chemical properties of different wines and aims to classify them into three categories. The project compares the performance of Gaussian Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes models.

# Features:
- Data Loading: Utilizes the sklearn.datasets wine dataset.
- Data Exploration: Explores features such as alcohol content, ash, and others.
- Data Splitting: Splits the data into training and testing sets with a 70-30 ratio.
- Model Training: Trains Gaussian Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes classifiers.
- Model Evaluation: Compares the accuracy of both classifiers on the test set.
- Results: Gaussian Naive Bayes achieves 100% accuracy, while Multinomial Naive Bayes achieves 77.78% accuracy.
  
# Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
